# CA-Term-Project

## Overview
This project is an implementation of a 3-stage pipelined processor with support for Control and Status Registers (CSRs). The processor is designed for efficient and parallel execution of instructions, enhancing overall performance. The inclusion of CSRs allows for improved control and monitoring of the processor's behavior.
